I suggest that you use Notepad++ to edit!
And! Many configuration options in wcd_settings.lua. Check it! :)


AUTO GENERATE ALL YOUR TDM CARS(you will have to set up your price, restrictions etc):
go to your Server Console/Web Console
type lua_run GenerateAllMyCarsPlease()
look in your FTP: garrysmod/data/TDMCARSGENERATED.lua
paste this in wcd_cars.lua, below this:
function InitializeSharedCarDealer()

	if( !CarDealer ) then
		return;
	end
	
then you have to set up your prices, restrictions, disallow stuff etc


in wcd_cars.lua it's carefully explained how to set up cars.

To add a car dealer:
Q > Entities > William's items > Car Dealer
Spawn him and put him where you want.
Write: !cardealer (while looking at him).

Dealer id = what cars does he deal?
(you configure each car's dealerid in wcd_cars.lua. If a car has no dealerid, it will default to 0!)

Model = Should have a different model?
Hold Q > right click a ragdoll > Copy to clipboard
Not all ragdolls works(not my fault!)

Name = What is his name(General Vehicles, Police Dealer, Taxi Manager etc)

Save Configuration.

Add Platform:
Create a platform which cars that this dealer spawns, will be spawned on top of.
If a platform has a player, or a car, or a prop on it, it will look for a different platform,
so set up multiple platforms!

----------------

Fuel Pump:
Spawn a fuel pump, place it as you want.
Done!


!caradmin > Save All Car Dealers/Fuel Pumps!

All done!
